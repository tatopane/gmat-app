# GMAT App
by Martin (Tato) Panelati

# Description
A simple app to practice random GMAT questions sourced from GMAT Club (gmatclub.com). I was having a hard time browsing questions and not reading the responses, so I created this simple app that serves questions and lets me practice.

It helped me finally get 730 in Nov 2018.


# How to use
1. Install python 3.7 and flask in your computer
2. Run the app by typing in your terminal:
	- $ export FLASK_APP=app.py
	- $ flask run
3. Go to chrome and open http://127.0.0.1:5000/
